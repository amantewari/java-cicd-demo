Description:
We are exploring the option of provisioning an on-premises server to act as a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner.
The runner will primarily be used for build and installation processes in our CI/CD pipelines.

Before proceeding, we would like to confirm with the GitHub team if this setup is feasible and supported within our existing GitHub Enterprise environment.

Details:
	•	Purpose: To run build and install workflows directly on an on-prem server instead of using GitHub-hosted runners.
	•	Expected Usage:
	•	Build Java-based applications
	•	Perform installation on internal servers after build
	•	Requirements:
	•	Network and security prerequisites for connecting the on-prem runner to GitHub
	•	Any necessary approvals or configuration changes on the GitHub side
	•	Guidelines for managing authentication, tokens, and runner groups

Action Requested:
Kindly confirm whether:
	1.	It is feasible to configure an on-prem server as a GitHub Actions runner within our organization’s setup.
	2.	Any specific security, access, or configuration steps need to be followed before we proceed with provisioning.

Next Steps (if approved):
Once confirmed, we’ll share server details and coordinate setup with the infra
